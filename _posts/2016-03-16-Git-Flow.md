In this post I present the development model that I've introduced for some of
my projects (both at work and private) about a year ago, and which has turned
out to be very successful. I've been meaning to write about it for a while now,
but I've never really found the time to do so thoroughly, until now. I won't
talk about any of the projects details, merely about the branching strategy and
release management.

## Summary
While there is nothing really shocking new to this branching model, the "big
picture" figure that this post began with has turned out to be tremendously
useful in our projects. It forms an elegant mental model that is easy to
comprehend and allows team members to develop a shared understanding of the
branching and releasing processes.

A high-quality PDF version of the figure is provided here. Go ahead and hang it
on the wall for quick reference at any time.
